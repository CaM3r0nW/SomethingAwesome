# SomethingAwesome
PS:

Implement a local(within terminal) chat program where users can communicate using substitution ciphers (Caesar cipher is a simplified version of this) using a key that both users have agreed upon prior.
Document how the program works and explain the function and weaknesses of the cipher(s) used.
 

CR:

Automatically crack substitution cipher (Document / write up your technique and methodology of doing this)
Add authentication to your program (Document) with a simulated third party who can't access messages.
 

DN:

Automatically crack transposition cipher, and determines key length – we’ll go over it later in the course, too. (A harder cipher that involves a key!)
Documentation explains theory of index of coincidence and how this was used to crack the encryption.
 

HD:

Implement key exchange protocol to allow sharing of keys securely over an insecure channel (making sure people on the outside won’t be able to intercept and steal the keys!)
Documentation explains concept of key exchange and how this works.
